Troubleshooting:
<Windows>
If the program doesn't run, then you must right click it and select "Run as Administrator"

<Mac>
If the message ""2dworld" was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer" do this:
1. Go to System Preferences and click on Security & Privacy
2. Somewhere near the bottom you'll see a message and then a button "Open Anyway". Click it.
3. A prompt will come up saying ""2dworld is a Unix applicaiton downloaded from the internet. Are you sure you want to open it?" Click open.

If you're using Linux, you can probably figure out how to get it running on your own.
